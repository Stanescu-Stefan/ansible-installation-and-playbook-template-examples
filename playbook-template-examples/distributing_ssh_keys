#we will create an ansible playbook that will distribute ssh public keys
#we need to create a directory if not already present to place the ansible configuration file

cd ~

mkdir ansible

cd ansible

vim ansible.cfg

#the config file can be written as an INI format

[defaults]
inventory=./inventory
remote_user=root

#save the file, :wq
#now we can create the inventory file, that is a list of hosts or a host group

vim inventory

#write inside the inventory file the following 192.168.122.[4:5], which represents 2 IPs for 2 hosts

#we can list the hosts by typing the following

ansible all --list-hosts

#we need to connect to the remote hosts to populate the known_hosts
#in our case we can manually connect to those hosts, but when you have hundreds of hosts, you cant do that

#we can use the sshpass utility
